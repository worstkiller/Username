=====

>The name itself implies development in Hindi language and i have been doing this to `mobile applications` from almost 6 years now 😄. I love being a developer and contributing to community in possible ways. I have worked on many `frameworks`, IDE for application development and `Eclipse with ADT` is one of them 😬. I'm a self taught Android developer 😉 and try to learn and improve everyday. I like making jokes which unfortunately only i understand 😅 apart from that I'm a district level `Cricket` player, and a street level `Badminton` player, `Covid-19` made me a survivor also 😆.
