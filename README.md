The name itself implies development in Hindi language and i have been doing this to mobile applications from almost 6 years now ðŸ˜„. I love being a developer and contributing to community in possible ways. I have worked on many frameworks, IDE for application development and Eclipse with ADT is one of them ðŸ˜¬. I'm a CSE graduate and fortunately didn't got what they taught me and ended being a self learner ðŸ˜‰.
